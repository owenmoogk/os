export var blurb = `Hey, I'm Owen Moogk

I'm currently a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, quite passionate about engineering and design. I made this website to work on my web development skills as well as showcase some work. Check out my projects page for details on personal endeavors with programming, mechanical design, web development, and 3D printing.

I've recently completed a internship as a Software Developer at BusPlanner, where I worked to develop a fullstack application for the BusPlanner Student Transportation Suite, allowing clients to easily plan and implement transportation solutions.

This winter, I have accepted a internship in a Research and Development engineering role at the University of Lethbridge Neuroengineering Hub, and am very excited to spend the winter in Alberta, working and learning more about hardware development and project development.

In high school, I worked as a student on the FRC robotics team 2702 Rebels, involved myself in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, and attended the prestigious month-long SHAD program. For more info, check out my work page.
